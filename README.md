## Description
**PokéSet Tracker** is a Python-based graphical application designed to help Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) collectors keep track of their card sets, specifically for the **Pokémon TCG Pocket**. This tool allows you to easily monitor your progress across different Pokémon card sets and sub-sets, display which cards you own, and calculate the completion percentage of your collection.

Additionally, it includes an intelligent feature that recommends the optimal pack to open based on the number of cards you're missing from each sub-set!

This project was inspired by the community-driven passion for Pokémon cards, and I've had the pleasure of receiving assistance from OpenAI's ChatGPT throughout the development process.

## Features
- **Card Collection Visualization**: Display the entire set of cards with checkboxes to mark the ones you own.
- **Completion Percentage**: Track your progress in completing the set, including sub-sets.
- **Optimal Pack Recommendation**: Suggests the most optimal pack to open based on which cards you still need.
- **Sub-set Management**: Manage your collection by separating cards into their respective sub-sets (or packs).
- **Save Progress**: (Coming Soon) Save and load your collection progress in a file (CSV/JSON).

## Inspiration
This project was created as part of my Hacktoberfest 2024 contribution, where I wanted to blend my love for Pokémon TCG with coding. 
I have received invaluable support and guidance from OpenAI's ChatGPT in the process of building this tool.
